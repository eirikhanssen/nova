		<h2>Sammendrag av publikasjonen</h2>
		
<p>Norway ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on 8 January 1991. All countries that have ratified the Convention undertake to report to the UN on their compliance every five years. Norway´s fourth report is to be delivered in spring 2008. As part of that report the Ministry of Children and Equality wished to communicate children and young people´s views on growing up in Norway, seen in relation to some articles of the UN Convention. Eight municipalities were invited to obtain the views of children and young people. They were the Alna district of Oslo, Alta, Bjugn, Kautokeino, Lillesand, Sandnes, Skedsmo and Trondheim. NOVA was asked to provide guidance for the project and to present the results in an overall report.</p>    <h2>Background and framework for the project</h2><p>The chapter describes the project´s organisational set-up and implementation. Information was obtained from children and young people on core themes such as awareness of the Convention, well-being and co-determination at school, various forms of discrimination and unfair treatment, leisure activities and access to health services. Six municipalities carried out questionnaire-based surveys; three of them also employed qualitative interviews. Two municipalities confined themselves to qualitative interviews with various groups of informants.</p><p>The survey contains information from pupils at all levels of the compulsory school system, and, in one municipality, also day care centre children - in all 1,274 children and young people. This figure includes information from minority, refugee and asylum-seeking children and children who are clients of the child welfare service or other targeted services - In all 32 children and young people. The samples are not drawn in such a way as to ensure representativity, or in such a way that the results can be generalised, either to the particular municipality or to the country as a whole.</p>    <h2>Awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</h2><p>The survey showed that about half of the interviewed children and young people were aware of the UN Convention. Awareness levels varied widely, however. In one municipality two out of three reported that they knew of the Convention. In one grade in another municipality almost 86 per cent reported the same. Hence the results are somewhat better than in an earlier national survey in which about 38 per cent in the age range 15-24 answered that they knew of the Convention (Norway´s third report to the UN, 2003). The number of those who were aware of the Convention was exceeded by those who knew that they had rights at home, at school and in the wider society. This is an understandable result in as much as children´s rights are impelled by several sources.</p><p>Many knew little about the subject matter of the Convention, and what knowledge they possessed often came across as fragmentary. Several of the qualitative quotes and interviews none the less revealed a high degree of reflective ability, both with regard to personal circumstances and to the problems faced by children and young people in many other countries. Children and young people were particularly concerned with equality and fairness and by the fact that their counterparts in other parts of the world face a more difficult life situation than they do themselves. It is worrying that children from refugee services and asylum reception centres appeared to be less aware of the Convention than others.</p><p>The answers showed that children´s knowledge of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child varied from one municipality to the next, indeed even within the same school and grade. This can reasonably be interpreted in light of differences in municipal organisation, differing priorities at schools and also among teachers. Despite the fact that awareness of the Convention and of their own rights had reached many children, there are no institutionalsafeguards to ensure that all children and young people are made aware of the Convention and their rights.</p>    <h2>Children´s well-being and co-determination at school</h2><p>Children´s and young people´s answers showed that a large majority were happy at school, in their class/group and at break time, from about 60 to more than 90 per cent. This accords with findings in a series of other surveys (Bakken 2003, Kjærnsli et al. 2004). However, surveys also show that up to 20 per cent are not happy and, in the case of about 5 per cent of the latter, life at school is onerous (Nordahl 2008). In the present survey too a number of pupils struggled with various aspects of school life due to relations with fellow pupils and/or teachers. A large majority had friends and someone to talk to. At the same time the number reporting that they had friends to spend time with far exceeded the number who experienced school as a completely safe and secure place to be. In one municipality more than 30 per cent stated that some pupils at school never left them in peace. In other words friends do not provide sufficient protection.</p><p>A majority of pupils also reported being on good terms with their teacher, and many mentioned examples of situations or teachers they were happy with. But they also reported wide differences between teachers and unfair treatment of pupils by teachers. The difficulties of rectifying circumstances they were not happy with were pointed out. They felt both that their voice was not heard and that criticism was not well received.</p><p>There were fairly large variations from one municipality to the next as regards pupils´ co-determination at school. Between 43 per cent and 83 per cent were of the opinion that they received good tuition in co-determination and participation. Between about 61 per cent and 76 per cent considered that the teachers encourage pupils to participate in the work of the pupils´ council. Between about 50 per cent and 90 per cent or more said they agreed completely or to some extent´ that the pupils´ council wielded large influence or that its voice was at least heard. In general it can be said that children and young people desired a say in decision-making, and that the school went some way towards complying, but not as far as the pupils desired.</p><p>The pupils´ answers showed that teachers play a key role in facilitating tuition in and practice of children´s rights, and it is clear from the above paragraph that many teachers are doing a good job on this front. Even so the pupils´ answers indicated that fortuitousness ? or the individual teacher´s personal motivation played too great a part in whether or not pupils received tuition in democratic processes, in whether or not the stage was set for a functioning pupil democracy and whether or not they were treated with respect. The pupils pointed out that their personal commitment was also needed if pupil democracy was to work.</p>    <h2>Discrimination and unfair treatment</h2><p>A large majority of children and young people did not believe they were subjected to discrimination or unfair treatment at school. Given the fact that most, by far, of the pupils who took part in the survey were born in Norway of Norwegian parents, this is not a surprising finding. To a specific question on who, in the event, perpetrated the discrimination, several pupils said they were subjected to unfair treatment by pupils and teachers alike. Between 33 per cent and 76 per cent said that they were never treated unfairly by teachers. Several municipalities were struck by the fact that from 10 to 14 per cent felt unfairly treated by teachers two to three times a month or more.</p><p>Children and young people of both Norwegian and minority background expressed the view that some discrimination was on grounds of ethnicity. In the present survey as in many others children and young people with a non-Norwegian ethnic backgroundsaid they were very happy at school, even though they reported, more often than their Norwegian counterparts, that they were not left in peace and were subjected to discrimination. Based on the qualitative interviews, young people may appear to have taken over the wider society´s critical gaze on themselves. When reporting experiences of discriminatory or unfair treatment, they often added comments such as &quot;I´m not playing ghetto, by the way!&quot; They levelled a similarly critical gaze at others with other ethnic origins. &quot;We think like that ourselves, that foreigners make trouble!&quot; Some highlighted bullying between different immigrant groups, a problem that has received little attention in Norway.</p><p>A group that arouses particular concern is refugee and asylum-seeking children. Not many such children participated in the present survey, but from Alta in the north to Sandnes in the south they told of an absence of friends and inclusion, the discomfort of being placed in a separate class at school, the feeling of being deliberately excluded from the society at large by lack of transport to leisure activities, and the sense of poverty and of living in conditions far poorer than those enjoyed by other children and young people in Norway. This is serious feedback.</p><p>Bullying is seen as a widespread problem at Norwegian primary schools. Like its predecessors, the present survey confirmed that bullying takes place on a substantial scale. 52 and 67 per cent in two municipalities respectively reported that they had been subjected to no bullying whatsoever, while between 7 and 8 per cent reported being bullied two to three times a month or more. The respondents considered that demands for a stop to be put to bullying and for bullying to have visible consequences in the form of penalties, expulsion or other sanctions, should be effectively enforced.</p><p>Children and young people expressed the view that differential treatment of boys and girls was frequent. Specifically, the boys thought girls were treated better and faced laxer requirements in a number of areas. It was not clear whether the girls agreed with these assessments and, if so, whether they regarded such discrimination as positive or negative.</p>    <h2>Leisure, assistance services and thoughts about the future</h2><p>The interviews showed that the municipalities offered a number of leisure facilities. Most interviewees were happy with the facilities available, although they did have suggestions as regards other measures they would like to see introduced. Many called for more facilities for unorganised young people such as recreational clubs, places to meet at weekends and venues devoted to unorganised sports. It is interesting to compare this wish list with the priorities they would have selected had they been politicians on the municipal council: in that position they would have granted funds to increase efforts to combat crime and violence, drugs and racism!</p><p>Several called for more facilities for unorganised youth and venues devoted to unorganised sports: &quot;If you´ve got nothing to do, you go out, wander around without purpose and suddenly you start doing silly things&quot; as one young person put it, referring to the drop in criminality that was seen after the introduction of more facilities for unorganised youth where he was living.</p><p>A majority decided over their leisure activities themselves, although they also discussed the matter with their parents. Some expressed the view that obligations at home took up their leisure time. Poor finances also curbed their participation. Above all, young people at asylum reception centres said they were unable to participate in leisure activities on account of poor finances.</p><p>Children and young people were generally fairly familiar with the municipality´s health and social services and knew where to seek assistance if they or someone they knew had a health problem or difficulties at home.More of them knew where to turn with a health problem than with problems at home. Most of them, by far, would contact a public health nurse, although it was pointed out that she tended not to be available. Others also mentioned a teacher or school counsellor, someone at the recreational club, a doctor, psychologist or the child welfare service. It was important for the young people that the services were accessible and that the staff observed the duty of confidentiality.</p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The survey showed that about half of the children and young people in the participating municipalities knew of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. A higher proportion knew that they had rights. Teaching and enforcement of children´s rights at school and in their leisure time can without doubt be improved. The survey brought to light wide municipal variations. Hence an important conclusion is that there are no institutional safeguards to ensure that children and young people in Norway are made aware of the Convention, of their own rights and the significance to them of such rights.</p><p>Children and young people were quick to respond on the issue of deciding over their personal everyday life. One young person put it as follows: &quot;Just because we have a good life doesn´t mean that we can demand everything we want. We also have obligations.&quot; They were also preoccupied with combating bullying and discrimination in Norway, and children´s situation in other parts of the world meant a lot to them. It will be important to build on this readiness to assume responsibility in the further planning of tuition in children´s and young people´s rights.</p>		<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="close_summary_trigger">Lukk sammendrag</a>
